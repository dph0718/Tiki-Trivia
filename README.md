# Tiki Bar Trivia
[Click here to play the game.](https://dph0718.github.io/Tiki-Trivia/)
1. This is a trivia game.
2. Read the question and choose the answer you believe to be correct.
3. Don't wait too long! You lose possible points the longer you take to answer.
4. If you get one wrong, you have to take a shot*. This will make it harder to answer subsequent questions.
5. You'll sober up as you wait, but again, possible points will decrease as you wait.

_*All the shot-taking is within the browser. You **do not** have to literally, in real life, take a shot. Unless you want to._

## Getting started:
- This is just HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript/jQuery.
- Fork the repository and begin tweaking in your favorite editor.
